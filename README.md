# Sudoku-Image-Solver

### Tools and libraries used:
1) OpenCV-Python : For using image processing algorthims for Grid Extraction and Digits Extraction.
2) Keras, Scikit-Learn : For implementing ML models for recognizing digits extracted from the image
3) I have also used Swig for creating Python bindings of C++ code for solving the puzzle recognized from the image.
